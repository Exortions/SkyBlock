<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

Hypixel SkyBlock, a Minecraft game, is a very interesting new take on the Minecraft experience. With crazy new features, an economy (even a rip-off stock market), custom armor, weapons, abilities, bosses, and more! It's revolutionized the Minecraft experience, and is very fun to play around in. Me (Exortions), and a friend (OptimusChen) decided to create this Hypixel SkyBlock Remake as a fun side-project (Though, now it has become our main project). The goal of this project is to replicate the Hypixel SkyBlock experience as much as possible.

Here's why:
* Because sometimes it isn't fun to play the real game (Mostly because nothing is fun if you can't cheat)
* It's fun to re-learn Spigot plugin development, as well as work with many APIs :smile:
* Hypixel SkyBlock is such a massive gamemode, therefore re-creating it is a very big challenge. And, I think I can speak for most humans when I say: "I like a challenge".

Of course, this project is a side project, and is NOT to be used for commercial use. If people do start using it for commercial use, we might have to take down the open-sourceness of this project.

A list of commonly used resources that we used to create this project can be found in the acknowledgements.

### Built With

This section is all of the frameworks/applications that were used in the process of making this Hypixel SkyBlock Remake. You can see some smaller things towards the bottom of this page in the Acknowledgements section.
* [IntelliJ](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/)
* [Maven](https://maven.apache.org/)
* [Spigot](https://www.spigotmc.org/)

### Prerequisites

  Here's the great thing about all of this: You don't need any other plugins to run this SkyBlock Remake! The plugin is also coded in the most efficient way, to prevent lag & unwanted glitches/bugs.

### Installation

If you want to install this for yourself, and only yourself (Limited to a small group of friends) for a Minecraft server, you can do so with the following instructions.
IF YOU ARE TRYING TO PROFIT OFF OF THIS PLUGIN, PLEASE BE WARNED THAT IT IS NOT LEGAL, AS THE GAME SKYBLOCK IS OWNED BY [HYPIXEL](https://hypixel.net/), AND THIS IS A FUN SIDE PROJECT THAT IS NOT MEANT TO BE FOR COMMERCIAL USE.
1. Ensure that your server .jar is Spigot 1.8.9
2. Download the dependencies from the dependencies folder
3. Download a release from the Releases section.
4. Move the downloaded JAR into your server plugins folder
   `MainServerFolder/plugins`
4. Restart your server.
5. Download the SkyBlock hub [here](https://www.mediafire.com/file/rosqqsrtqidkly1/Hypixel_-_Skyblock_Hub.zip/file)
6. Make the SkyBlock hub your spawning world
7. Stop your server
8. Take the private_island.schematic file from the dependencies folder and put it in 
  `MainServerFolder/plugins/RemakeHypixelSkyblock/`
10. Start your server again.
11. Log onto the server! Bam! You now have SkyBlock running on your private server.
Important note: Launch pads and custom mob spawning locations won't work because you need to edit the mobspawns.yml and the launchpad.yml. Those files will directly be added later to the GitHub.

<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->
## Usage

As said above, if you are downloading this project, you agree to the policy/terms/conditions of this project. Do not attempt get commercial use from this project, because the idea of Hypixel SkyBlock was created by the Hypixel admins, therefore I do not have the right to give this out to people for them to make money off of.
